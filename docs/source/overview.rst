Overview of the EPRV FITS Data Standard
***************************************

Purpose
=======

A new generation of Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV)
cross-dispersed echelle spectrographs have come on-line in the past
decade and are now producing large quantities of data in support of
stellar, exoplanet, and galactic astrophysics. The EPRV community is
pushing towards a goal of achieving measurement precision at the 10
cm/s level, sufficient for detecting an Earth mass planet in an
Earth-like orbit around a Sun-like star. The data from these
instruments is complicated, and must be handled carefully in each
instrument's Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP) to avoid degrading the
intrinsic data qualtiy. Numerous derived products, including radial
velocities, stellar activity indicators, line shape assessments, and
other quantities, are routinely produced by DRPs for use in scientific
analyses. Sufficient data now exists for the same targets across
multiple instruments to investigate effects from different hardware
and software choices, which can impact how current instruments are
used and also how future instruments are designed.

These EPRV instruments generate data in native formats that were
defined by individual instrument teams at the time of construction,
rather than utilizing a common standard, which has introduced
unecessary complication in processes such as building and maintaining
data archives, carrying out scientific investigations that utilize
data from multiple instruments, and making cross-comparisons of
intrument internal performances. To address these issues, the **EPRV
Data Standardization Project** has brought together an international
collaboration of instrumentalists and software developers from existing
and future echelle spectrograph projects to *define a standard data format
for multiple levels of processed echelle data*. The project has also
generated *translator* software to convert files from their
native instrument formats into the standard format.  This project
was started in 2024, and expects to release the first versions for the
*standard definition* and the *translator software* in the first half
of 2026.

New echelle spectrographs are encouraged to use the *standard* data
format for their native data. Existing instrument teams who do not
have a *translator* are encouraged to engage with the project to
generate code for their instruments.

The **EPRV Data Standardization Project** was funded by `NASA EPRV
Foundational Science Grant 22-EPRV22_2-0018

Data Standard Overview
======================

The EPRV Data Standard stores data in FITS files and is compliant with
`FITS v4.0 <https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_standard.html>`. The
standard defines data products at different *Levels* of processing,
and places requirements on filenames, structure, and contents.

#. All compliant files will be named using the following scheme: **<inst>_SL<#>_<timestamp>.fits**

   #. **<inst>** : Instrument name or abbreviation, in lower-case. (e.g., neid, kpf, expres). Different cameras are treated as separate instruments (e.g., for Maroon-X: mxred, mxblue)
   #. **<SL#>** : Standard Level #, where # is typically 2, 3, 4, etc.
   #. **<timestamp>** : Start of Exposure, corresponding to header DATE-OBS keyword. Limited to *YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS*. In cases where fractional seconds are required to distinguish files, add milliseconds as *sss*.

#. Standard data levels are defined as follows:

   #. Level 0 is not defined by the standard, but is
      envisioned to be the native raw data format returned by the
      instrument.
   #. Level 1 is not definied by teh standard, bu t is
      envisioned to be a minimally processed image data that is
      assembled to resemble the detector focal plane, and stored in an
      image extension. If a detector has multiple amplifiers, Level 1
      contains a complete image in a physical pixel reference
      frame. This data level can have overscan and bias corrections
      applied.  Details of headers and additional extensions are not
      defined by the data standard. It is allowable that Level 1 is
      identical to Level 0, if the lowest level product returned by
      the instrument is a fully assembled image.
   #. Level 2 will contain the 1D extracted order-by-order flux,
      wavelength, variance, and blaze in individual extensions. If the
      spectrograph produces N spectral traces, which corresponding to
      N object inputs in the detector optical input, (e.g., a
      calibration trace, a sky trace, one or more science traces),
      then each trace will be preserved in a separate set of
      extensions. The barycentric motion correction will be calculated
      and included in a separate extension, but not applied to the
      wavelength solution.
   #. Level 3 will contain a 1D spectra with all orders stitched
      together. The flux array will be blaze corrected and the
      wavelength solution will be corrected for instrument drift and
      barycentric motion. The variance array will be calculated using
      the blaze-corrected flux.
   #. Level 4 will contain derived data products such as RV
      measurements, cross-correlation functions and metrics, and
      stellar activity indicators.
