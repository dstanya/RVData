HDU,Name,DataType,Multiplicity,Required,Description,Comments
0,PRIMARY,PrimaryHDU,False,True,EPRV Standard FITS HEADER (no data),Carried forward from L2 FITS file. Append BJDTDB; RV; RVERR; BERV; RVMETHOD; and SYSVEL header keywords.
1,INSTRUMENT_HEADER,ImageHDU,False,True,Inherited instrument header (no data),Carried forward from L2 FITS file.  
2,RECEIPT,BinTableHDU,False,True,Table of operations that have been performed on this file,Table has columns: time; code release; branch name; commit hash; function; args; status.
3,DRP_CONFIG,BinTableHDU,False,True,Pipeline details (settings etc) to go from native data to L2,Table has one column where each row captures a config entry.
4,EXT_DESCRIPT,BinTableHDU,False,True,Table describing contents of each extension,Table has two columns and each one row contains the name of an extension in the HDU and then a string description of what is in that extension.
4,RV1,BinTableHDU,True,True,Derived Radial Velocity Measurement,Required Columns: BJD_TDB (64bit); RV from Trace1...N; RV_Error; BC_Velocity; Wave_Start (64bit); Wave_End (64bit). Optional columns [teams can add more if they like]: pixel_start; pixel_end; order_index; echelle_order; weight; residual_drift.
5,CCF1,ImageHDU,True,False,CCFs from which RV1...N were derived,Same shape as RV1...N. Contains the CCF(s) that produced each RV1...N value.
6,DIAGNOSTICS1,BinTableHDU,True,False,Activity indicators; CCF metrics; etc,Table containing useful diagnostic measurements. Does not have same dimensions as RV1/CCF1. Suggested structure is to have columns for : BJD_TDB; metric_name; value; and error.
7,CUSTOM_CCF1,ImageHDU,True,False,Additional CCFs from (e.g.) different masks,Additional CCF extensions; used to capture results from different masks or different CCF calculation methods.
8,CUSTOM_RV1,BinTableHDU,True,False,Derived Radial Velocity Measurement from CUSTOM_CCF1...N,Additional RV extensions; used to capture RV values corresponding to CUSTOM_CCF1...N
